            <hr>
            <p>Non-linearity is central to Ó Deasún's work, with his video installation constructing and reconstructing itself over and over again in real time. These live visuals have been collected across the events of a single day.</p>
            <p>Using generative software, the artist is illustrating memories from the past as being in constant flux, in play with the present moment. By removing mathematics and linearity from our concept of time, we can begin to explore the human experience as a dynamic process; a constant state of becoming.</p>
            <p>Featured in the space is a generative video piece, perpetually re-arranging and re-making itself in real-time. Alongside the video work are two polythene plastic inflatables housed in the back windows, these forms inflate and deflate every 10 minutes.</p>

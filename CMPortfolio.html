        <p>From May-June 2023 I worked to promote the NCAD 2023 Degree Show ‘NCAD Works’. This meant working with a large group of artists to ensure each piece was documented respectfully and appropriately. The outcomes of this project were a long form video-walkthrough of the show to send to curators, artists and members of the public who could not make the show as well as promotional videos to be posted on social media.</p>

        <p>This is the promotional video I made during the marketing process for my most recent exhibit ‘Catching Something Moving’. When documenting work like this it is important that the footage captures all physical elements of a piece while also portraying the feeling of being in this space. Find out more about the piece here. </p>

        <p>This second piece was developed by myself and fellow artist Campbell Gibson. As the work was made during a period of lockdown over covid, it was crucial that we developed a strong online presence for the work as well as a range of content for people to explore and spend time with. The outcomes of this being a printed book, an accompanying interactive webpage as well as a series of promotional videos. </p>

        <p>The third piece in this section is the promotional work made for a photo zine published with the Library Project - Dublin in 2020. Again this was a project which took place during covid therefore needing a particularly strong online presence. The outcomes were a series of short videos made specifically for Instagram.</p>
